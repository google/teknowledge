# Who/what is Teknowledge?
Teknowledge's mission is to create a introductory CS curriculum for text-based programming. (This is not a Google product, but worked on as part of a Googler's 20% time.)

The current curriculum is being developed targeting 7th-8th grade students in Pittsburgh, though we aim to share it as widely as it finds use.

# Using Teknowledge's Curriculum

There are two curriculums in this repository.

* curriculum/ - This folder contains our original curriculum as developed and used for our Fall 2017 programs.
* curriculum_v2/ - This folder contains a revised version of the original curriculum as used for our Spring 2018 programs. Note that this curriculum is incomplete as presented here; the third part of our curriculum used a proprietary python environment for more advanced graphics programming, thus we could not open-source that portion.

See each folder's individual README file for more details.
